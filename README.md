# Swing State: Predicting At-Bat Outcomes with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether a baseball player will get on base (hit, walk, or home run) or not (strikeout, pop-out, etc.). By leveraging baseball statistics from the pybaseball library and machine learning algorithms, we aim to build a model that can accurately forecast at-bat outcomes.

## Motivation
Baseball is a data-rich sport, and by applying machine learning, we can uncover patterns that predict performance in various situations. This project will serve as a great addition to my personal portfolio, showcasing my skills in data collection, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pybaseball for data collection
- Scikit-learn for model building
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required packages from `requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in sequence

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and model building
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing and modeling
