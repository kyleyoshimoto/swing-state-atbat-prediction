# swing-state-atbat-prediction
This project aims to predict whether a MLB baseball player will get on base (hit, walk, home run) or not (strikeout, pop-out, etc.). By leveraging baseball statistics from the pybaseball library and machine learning algorithms, we aim to build a model that can accurately forecast at-bat outcomes.
